setValue( p - 1)

Doesn't account for potential concurrency issues if the value is being modified by other parts of the code or in a multi-threaded environment. */

----When you click the "Decrement Directly" button repeatedly in quick succession, you might see unexpected behavior due to potential concurrency issues. The counter might not update as expected.


--------------------------------------
setValue((p) => p - 1)

Helps avoid potential concurrency issues because you're working with the previous value in a functional manner.

If you want to ensure that you're working with the most up-to-date value and need to perform more complex calculations, the functional update approach (setValue((p) => p - 1)) might be more appropriate.

When you click the "Decrement Functionally" button repeatedly, you won't encounter the concurrency issue because the functional update ensures that you're working with the latest value of the state.
