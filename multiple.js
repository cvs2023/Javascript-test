Non Mutator methods - slice( slice juice nhi chlta ) concat map filter reduce

map() method creates a new array by applying a given function to each element of the original array. The resulting array will have the same length as the original array, but with each element transformed by the function.

reduce() method applies a function to each element of the array to reduce the array to a single value. The function takes two arguments: an accumulator and the current element. It accumulates a value while iterating through the array from left to right.

filter() method creates a new array containing only the elements of the original array that meet a certain condition specified by a callback function. The callback function should return a Boolean value that indicates whether the element should be included in the resulting array.
